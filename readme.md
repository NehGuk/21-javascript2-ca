This was my Javascript 2 Course Assignment: the task was to produce a new JavaScript front-end client for an existing social media platform.

## Goal

To apply knowledge of JavaScript techniques to implement the front-end functionality for a social media application.

- The client application must be attractive and responsive;
- Using the provided API and API documentation
- Create a functioning user interface that allows for viewing, posting, editing and deleting social media content.
- Social API routes require authorisation via JWT (JSON Web Tokens). You will need to register an account and login to access your token.

## Built with

- HTML
- Bootstrap CSS
- Javascript
- VSCode
